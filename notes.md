A server is a computer or device that provides services, resources, or data to other computers or devices over a network. It acts as a central hub that manages and distributes information, applications, or services to clients, which are typically computers, laptops, or mobile devices.

### Key Characteristics of a Server:

- `Centralized`: A server is a central point of access for multiple clients.
- `Resource Provider`: A server provides resources, such as files, applications, or services, to clients.
- `Network Connectivity`: A server is connected to a network, which enables communication with clients.
- `Multi-User Support`: A server can support multiple clients simultaneously.

### Types of Servers:

- `Web Server`: Hosts websites and serves web pages to clients.
- `File Server`: Stores and manages files, providing access to clients.
- `Database Server`: Manages and provides access to databases.
- `Mail Server`: Handles email communication and distribution.
- `Game Server`: Hosts online games and manages game sessions.

### In Simple Terms:

Think of a server like a librarian. Just as a librarian manages books and provides access to them, a server manages resources and provides access to them over a network.

## Q2. What is web server?

A web server is a type of server that hosts and serves websites, web applications, and web services over the internet. Its primary function is to store, process, and deliver web pages, websites, and web-based applications to clients, which are typically web browsers or mobile apps.

### Key Functions of a Web Server:

- `Hosting`: Stores website files, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and videos.
- `Request Handling`: Receives and processes HTTP requests from clients, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
- `Response Generation`: Generates and sends HTTP responses back to clients, including the requested web pages or data.
- `Security`: Implements security measures, such as authentication, authorization, and encryption, to protect the website and its data.

### How a Web Server Works:

1. A client (web browser or mobile app) sends an HTTP request to the web server.
2. The web server receives the request and processes it.
3. web server retrieves the requested resource (web page, image, etc.) from its storage.
4. The web server generates an HTTP response, which includes the requested resource.
5. The web server sends the HTTP response back to the client.
6. The client receives the response and displays the web page or resource.

### Examples of Web Servers:

- `Apache HTTP Server`: An open-source web server software.
- `Microsoft IIS (Internet Information Services)`: A web server software developed by Microsoft.
- `Nginx`: A popular open-source web server software.
- `Lighttpd`: A lightweight open-source web server software.

### In Simple Terms:

Think of a web server like a restaurant. Just as a restaurant stores food, prepares orders, and serves them to customers, a web server stores website files, processes requests, and serves web pages to clients.

## Node JS

- Nodejs is an open source `(open source means a software or program which is free to use and free to contribute for every developers globally)` and cross platform `(corss platform means a software or a programming language which runs same in every types of operating system like windows, linux, mac etc.)` software environment allows the developer to run javascript outside of the browser environment.

* Nodejs allows developers to use javascript programming language in server side.
* Nodejs build upon V8 engine (Chromes Javascript engines and a `c++ library` and `libuv library`)
